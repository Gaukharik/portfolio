SELECT * FROM menu_items;

-- 2.Find the number of items on the menu
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items;

-- 3.What are the least and most expensive items on the menu?
SELECT * FROM menu_items
ORDER BY price;

SELECT * FROM menu_items
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- 4.How many Italian dishes are on the menu?

WHERE category='Italian';

-- 5.What are the least and most expensive Italian dishes on the menu?
SELECT * 
FROM menu_items
WHERE category='Italian'
ORDER BY price;

SELECT * 
FROM menu_items
WHERE category='Italian'
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- 6.How many dishes are in each category? 
SELECT category, COUNT(menu_item_id) AS num_dishes 
FROM menu_items
GROUP BY category;

-- 7.What is the average dish price within each category?
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM menu_items
GROUP BY category;

-- OBJECTIVE 2: Explore the orders table

-- 1.View the order_details table
SELECT * FROM order_details;

-- 2.What is the date range of the table?
SELECT MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date) 
FROM order_details;

-- 3.How many orders were made within this date range? 
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM order_details;

-- 4.How many items were ordered within this date range?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_details;

-- 5.Which orders had the most number of items?
SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY num_items DESC;

-- 6.How many orders had more than 12 items?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 

(SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING num_items>12) AS num_orders;

-- OBJECTIVE 3: Analyze customer behavior

-- 1.Combine the menu_items and order_details tables into a single table
SELECT * FROM menu_items;
SELECT * FROM order_details;

SELECT * 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id=mi.menu_item_id;

-- 2.What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
SELECT item_name,category, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id=mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name, category
ORDER BY num_purchases DESC;

SELECT item_name,category, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id=mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name, category
ORDER BY num_purchases;

-- 3.What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_spend 
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id=mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- 4.View the details of the highest spend order. Which specific items were purchased?
SELECT category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id=mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id=440
GROUP BY category;

-- 5.View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders
SELECT order_id,category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
	ON od.item_id=mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id IN (440,2075,1957,330,2675)
GROUP BY order_id,category;

'440','192.15'
'2075','191.05'
'1957','190.10'
'330','189.70'
'2675','185.10'
